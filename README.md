Player Calculator for BT3 characters in DBZ League


DBZ League is all Com vs. Com fights, but the characters are built with help from the community, like you! Each team is led by a coach and a team of supporters that figure out how to build the characters with specific items that affect how they fight and what they can do

Please note this is still a WiP. The data here does not necessarily reflect the latest state of the league, especially with respect to mods. If you have specific questions, please contact a staff member.

We are happy to review any changes you'd like to make. To do so, please make changes to your local copy and send it to a DBZ League staff member on Discord. If we approve them, we will update the spreadsheet here. We recognize that this isn't the 'normal' way to use github, but please realize that the 'master' player calculator is kept in google doc, and the version kept here is simply an exported copy from Google Docs.

# How to use

There are 2 main ways you can use this calculator, first you can simply import the Player Calculator.ods file into Google sheets yourself, or you can open up the file in either MS Office or LibreOffice (https://www.libreoffice.org/ ). 

Once opened, navigate to the 'Output' sheet. In cell B3, select your team name from the drop down, then select the player name from the drop down in the cell next to it. Cells F14-21 are where you can add potaras for your build. As you update the drop downs, the calculator will automatically update the sheet with values based of the potaras.

Note: originally forked from: https://github.com/dbzleague/PlayerCalculator  We give our thanks to Burnarator for putting in a TON of time to do the groundwork for this.
